We may also refuse to process a Transaction or We may stop a Transaction from being completed if We believe that:</p>
    <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp;by doing so We might break any law, regulation, code or other duty and responsibility that applies to Us;</p>
    <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;by doing so it may expose Us to action from any government or regulator;</p>
    <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;it may be linked with any fraudulent or illegal activity; or</p>
    <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;You are in breach of these Terms and Conditions.</p>
    <p>Unless the law prevents Us, We may (at Our own discretion) inform the Remitter reasons for Our refusal and how the Remitter can rectify any errors in the instructions given.</p>

    <p><strong>4. Exchange Rate</strong></p>
    <p>The exchange rate quoted by Worlwide through the website is an indicative rate only and is subject to change as per market fluctuations; therefore the exchange rate is updated daily at different times.

This may appear separately on your bank statement and we do not accept any liability for these charges or any interest which may be applied. You should check the application of any such charges directly with the card issuer.</p>
    
    <p><strong>6. Using Our Service</strong></p>
    <p>We act only as a money transmitter and accept no responsibility or liability arising from Transactions between the sender and any third parties. (In particular, We accept no responsibility or liability for any goods or services including quality and delivery of them, which are paid for by money transfer). You are strictly cautioned in sending money to any person whom You do not know.</p>
    <p>If You want a Transaction to be dispatched on the same day, You need to submit the details and make payments for the Transaction on or before 4pm GMT (Monday to Friday).Those that are received after the cut off time will be processed on the same day but released along with the following business day's Transactions.</p>
    <p>Please note: In Bangladesh, the official weekend is Friday and Saturday; Banks are closed on these 2 days and therefore if You submit a transaction on Thursday after 4pm GMT time, the bank will only be able to process on Sunday when the banks re-open the working week. Banks are also closed for Official Bangladeshi Public Holidays like Eid, Diwali, Independence Day, Bengali New Year etc.</p>
    <p>Also take into consideration the time difference between the UK and Bangladesh (+5/6 hours). If You send a Transaction on a Thursday at 12pm , the time would be either 5pm or 6pm depending on season &ndash; therefore the bank will not be able to a process a Transaction until they re-open on the Sunday.</p>
    <p>The Remitter should not disclose the reference number, value of transfer or other information about the transfer to any other person other than the intended Beneficiary. Worldwide Services software is able to send an SMS to the Beneficiary with the Transaction details, so please ensure the Mobile number the Remitter provides is correct. Payments can be made by Debit or Credit card and is processed by our Payment gateway partner Paysafe, or Bank transfer to our segregated Account.</p>

    <p>You must inform Us immediately if You think that a transfer was not made properly or never arrived. We will not refund money to You if there is undue delay in informing Us about the problem and in any event if not informed within 6 months from the date of sending the money.</p>
    <p>We will not be liable to the Remitter for any incidental, indirect, special or consequential losses or costs or damages or for business losses (such as loss to business profits or opportunities) the Remitter suffers.</p>
    <p>The Remitter does not have the right to cancel the transfer once the Transaction is processed. Nevertheless if requested by the Remitter, We may at Our own discretion, cancel the transfer before it is paid out to the intended Beneficiary. If the Remitter wishes to cancel a money transfer and request a refund of the transfer amount, or make an amendment, the Remitter must request Us via and in writing via email along with a copy of the money transfer receipt provided to the Remitter. It is understood by the Remitter that all such cancellation or amendment requests shall be subject to the rules governing cancellations/amendments (including cancellation/ amendment charges) of the intermediary banks/financial service institution/other money service businesses that makes the pay-out to the intended Beneficiary.</p>
